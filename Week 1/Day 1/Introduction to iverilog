Design: The verilog codes which functions to meet the sepcification is called the design 
Simulation: The process of checking the RTL Design, if it is meeting the required spec is the simlation 
Tool Used: iverilog (open source tool)
Test Bench: Is the setup done by giving the stimulus(test vectors) to the design to verify if it matches with the specs

How Does a Simulator Work?
=> Only when there is a change in the input, there will be a change in the output in the simulator 

How Does a Testbench Work?
=>The Design is instantiated in the testbench
=>There is a stimulus generator that gives the primary inputs to the design 
=>There is a stimulus observer which observe the primary outputs from the design 
=>There is no primary input/primary output in the testbench 

iverilog simulation flow
=>The Design & Testbench are given to the iverilog 
=>The file generated from iverilog(simulator) will be a vcd file(value change dump) => when there is a change in the input, there is a change in the output => these changes are noted and dumped in the file.

gtkwave
=> the vcd file can be viewed in the gtkwave(waveform viewer)
